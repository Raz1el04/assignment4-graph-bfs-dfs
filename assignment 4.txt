Task 4: Graph, BFS and DFS Techniques
Course: CS 2055 (Data Structures and Algorithms) — Academic Year 2025–2026
Type: Solo Task (ST) | Language: Java or C++ | Submission: Document + GitHub
Summary
In this task, you will create a compact yet comprehensive graph toolkit and utilize it to address problems with
Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). You need to create a streamlined Graph API, select an
suitable internal modeling, manage edge cases, and explain time/space complexity.
Results of education
• Select suitable data structures and algorithms for managing and handling data (graphs).
• Accurately and efficiently execute BFS and DFS on various graph representations.
• Evaluate runtime efficiency based on input dimensions (|V|, |E|).
• Create well-structured, testable code and articulate your reasoning during code review.
Guidelines and limitations
• Avoid utilizing external graph libraries (e.g., NetworkX, JGraphT). It is permissible to utilize standard collections.
• Your solution should compile and execute from the command line (or through an IDE project) without any manual steps.
• The output of traversal should be consistent (establish and record the order of neighboring elements).
• Submissions made after the deadline will not be accepted. You need to prepare for defending your code orally
